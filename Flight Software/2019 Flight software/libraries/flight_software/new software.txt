Array with actuators, and index/pointer reference to currently active one.
Should be able to switch to another pod even if current one is open, e.g. stuck.

Don't do a 'switch' to an actuator THEN execute commands... thats bad


COMMANDS FORMAT:
	POD_1 FORCE ACTIVE (sets this actuator as the active one)
	POD_1 ACT_OVERRIDE OPEN (sets to override mode, opens [if override open, and wait till temperature then open])
	POD_1 ACT_OVERRIDE CLOSE (same as above but closes)
	POD_1 ACT_OVERRIDE RELEASE (releases back to auto-mode)
	POD_1 HEAT_OVERRIDE ENABLE (overrides the heater, turns it on)
	POD_1 HEAT_OVERRIDE DISABLE (turns it off)
	POD_1 HEAT_OVERRIDE RELEASE (releases back to auto-mode)
	POD_1 SET_OPEN_ALT ##### (sets the opening altitude)
	POD_1 SET_CLOSE_ALT ##### (sets close altitude)

CASES:
	Control lost: releases actuator override; heater override stays on if heater overridden to on, disables if it was overridden to off [want it to heat if it needs to])
	Actuator control released: releases actuator override; heater stays the same
	Heater control released: releases heater override; actuator stays the same

Forcing active changes the actuator reference to it, and it becomes 'active' (e.g. starts maintaining its temperature,
waiting for it to open/close).
This simply switches it to the active one, does not control actuator or heater behaviour, we just skipped in the schedule.


Once control switched, may force it open or closed. Once this is done, this is a true manual override and it will not proceed
automatically anymore unless control is released/connection lost. Once control released/lost, continues from wherever it was forced to
in the schedule. This is separate from heater override; heating will still be automatic unless overridden as well.


Heater override is a separate override and does not interfere with the auto-schedule. When the auto-scheduler is finished with an actuator,
the heater override is automatically disabled (since its switching to the next actuator anyways).


Opening and closing altitudes of an actuator may be changed (with current model it requires switching to it, which is fine?).





















Forcing active changes the actuator reference to it, and it becomes 'active' (e.g. starts maintaining its temperature,
waiting for it to open/close). (If its forced to while in its interval it will try to open immediately [Make it warm up to req temp
before attemping to move ever, UNLESS FORCED TO MOVE])

If control released/conn lost, continues automatically and normal checks. e.g. altitude check every time.
If its still in its interval, it does the rest of its interval automatically.
If outside its interval, it automatically closes and then continues to the next actuator in the list (does not go back and check for ones the manual override skipped)
