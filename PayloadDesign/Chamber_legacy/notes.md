each rod: 
22 x 1.6 mm

chamber door:
* should probably think more about the seal
* should we add grooves on the out-facing side of the door for the latch to latch onto? 
Maybe glue pieces of rubber that the latch will sit on?

===========
problems with v1:
	1. There isn't enough clearance or room to access the screws needed to hold the rod holder to its base. I think we can just make it into one piece to reduce the screws needed in general.
	2. The rod holder should be shorter so that the rods don't need to come out as far to be exposed. The over-center latch we plan on using for opening the chamber won't extend as far as this design needs.
	3. The chamber itself is also longer than necessary. Shortening it will give us some needed wiggle room inside the pelican case.
	4. Not included in this design are: the hole at the back of the chamber for the pressure relief via a syringe filter, the placement of the latches, or the hooks for the latches on the chamber door.
	
rod pattern:
	* staggered alternating rows of 6/5 holes
		* tray is 24x18mm
